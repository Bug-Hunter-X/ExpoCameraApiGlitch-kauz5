This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API in conjunction with specific device configurations or Expo SDK versions.  The issue manifests as an inability to properly access or process the camera feed, leading to a blank screen, frozen frames, or unexpected crashes.  The problem is intermittent and difficult to reproduce reliably, making debugging challenging. It's often linked to asynchronous operations within the camera's lifecycle and memory management issues.
