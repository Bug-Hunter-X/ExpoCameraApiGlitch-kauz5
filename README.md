# Expo Camera API Intermittent Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API. The issue manifests as an intermittent failure to display the camera feed, resulting in a blank screen or application crash. The root cause appears to be related to asynchronous operations and potentially memory management within the Expo Camera component.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the app: `expo start`
4. Observe the camera preview.  The issue is intermittent, so it may require multiple runs or specific device/SDK configurations to reproduce.

## Potential Causes

* Asynchronous operations within the camera lifecycle.
* Memory management issues, especially on lower-end devices.
* Incompatibility with certain Expo SDK versions.
* Race conditions related to camera permissions and initialization.

## Proposed Solution (cameraBugSolution.js)

The solution involves improved asynchronous handling and more robust error management.
